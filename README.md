# youtube-channels
Using youtube data api, I created a simple embed script that works with data tags 

I currently use my own API key in the example. You can obtain a new API key by following the instructions on the youtube website: https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application

I will probably add templating in the future. 

Dependencies: jQuery 1.9+

In my example I used bootstrap as a framework. Once I will add templating, it will be possible to use without any css framework.
